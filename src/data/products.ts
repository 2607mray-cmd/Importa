        <h3>The Science Behind the Blend</h3>
        <p>We don't leave taste to chance. Our master blenders have perfected a scientifically calibrated formula that remains unchanged batch after batch:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>60% Assam BP (Broken Pekoe)</strong> - Delivers the deep, malty sweetness and full-bodied character that North Indian consumers expect in their morning chai.</li>
          <li><strong>40% Dooars OF (Orange Fannings)</strong> - Contributes rapid color development, briskness, and that signature reddish-brown liquor strength.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This ratio isn't arbitrary—it's the result of extensive market testing and feedback from over 200 retail partners across North India.</p>

    longDescription: `
      <section>
        <p>In the traditional Indian tea market, there's an unspoken rule: <strong>"Chai must look like chai."</strong> Before taste, before aroma, comes color. The deep, rich, inviting red-brown liquor that signals strength and quality at first glance. <strong>Begam Gold</strong> is engineered precisely for this discerning market segment—where visual impact drives purchase decisions and repeat sales.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The "Lal Ghoda" Standard</h3>
        <p>Begam Gold delivers what tea connoisseurs in Bihar, UP, and traditional markets call <strong>"Lal Ghoda" (Red Horse) color</strong>—that intensely dark, reddish-brown liquor that appears instantly when milk is added. This isn't achieved through artificial coloring or dust-heavy blends. It's the result of carefully sourcing from select heavy-liquoring gardens in the Dooars region known for producing high-tannin, color-rich tea.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Regional Market Expertise</h3>
        <p>We understand that India doesn't drink tea the same way everywhere. In Bihar, UP, Jharkhand, and parts of MP, tea culture revolves around the traditional boiling method:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tea leaves boiled directly with water for 5-10 minutes</li>
          <li>Milk added and brought to a rolling boil</li>
          <li>Sugar incorporated during the boiling process</li>
          <li>Often re-boiled when serving the second round</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most blends collapse under this rigorous treatment—losing color, turning bitter, or producing a weak, washed-out cup. <strong>Begam Gold thrives in these conditions.</strong></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Built for Boiling: Superior Heat Stability</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Why Begam Gold Different</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>High Tannin Content:</strong> Sourced from Dooars gardens producing naturally high-polyphenol teas that maintain color intensity even when boiled repeatedly.</li>
            <li><strong>Coarse Particle Selection:</strong> Larger CTC granules release flavor and color gradually, preventing that "burnt" taste that comes from over-extraction.</li>
            <li><strong>Color Retention Technology:</strong> Our blending process prioritizes grades that maintain liquor color even when diluted with milk or boiled repeatedly.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistent Density:</strong> Every batch delivers the same deep color and strength.</li>

          <li><strong>Lower Tannin Levels</strong> - Results in a lighter, less astringent cup</li>
          <li><strong>Rapid Growth Cycle</strong> - Ensures younger, more tender leaves with delicate flavor profiles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This isn't just seasonal tea—it's the expression of what monsoon terroir brings to the cup.</p>

    longDescription: `
      <section>
        <p>In commercial tea service, the math is simple: cups per kilogram determines profitability. Whether you're running a roadside tea stall serving hundreds of customers daily, managing a factory canteen, or supplying corporate pantries, every gram counts. <strong>Priya Gold</strong> is precision-engineered for exactly this reality—maximum extraction, minimum waste, consistent results, and a price point that keeps your margins healthy.</p>
        <p>This isn't a blend designed for retail shelves or premium positioning. Priya Gold is the workhorse blend created specifically for high-volume, cost-sensitive commercial applications where performance per rupee is the only metric that matters.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Extraction Advantage</h3>
        <p>Priya Gold uses a carefully calibrated mix of particle sizes designed for rapid, complete extraction:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Medium-Sized CTC Granules (65%):</strong> Provide body, flavor foundation, and that satisfying depth customers expect.</li>
          <li><strong>High-Strength Dust Grade (35%):</strong> Instant color development and rapid caffeine extraction for the "kick" factor.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This dual-action formula means you extract more from every gram without needing to increase steeping time.</p>

    longDescription: `
      <section>
        <p>In the restaurant and cafe business, tea is where reputation meets margins. Serve poor quality and customers notice—online reviews suffer, repeat visits decline. Over-invest in premium blends and profitability evaporates on a beverage many consider "complimentary." <strong>Sabnam Gold</strong> is engineered for this precise sweet spot—the blend that makes your tea service a quiet competitive advantage rather than a cost center or complaint generator.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Hotel Special Philosophy</h3>
        <p>We call Sabnam Gold our 'Hotel Special' because it solves the unique challenge faced by mid-range restaurants, cafes, and hospitality businesses:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Your customers expect good tea—not artisanal, but good. The kind that complements their meal and doesn't trigger complaints.</li>
          <li><strong>The Solution:</strong> A blend that delivers consistent quality, pleasant flavor, attractive appearance, and rapid preparation—all while maintaining healthy F&B margins.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Why Mid-Range Hospitality Chooses Sabnam Gold</h3>
        
        <h4>1. The Visual Appeal Factor</h4>
        <p>In a restaurant or cafe, tea is often served in glass cups or white ceramic—your beverage is on display. Sabnam Gold produces that appealing <strong>golden-brown liquor</strong> that signals quality to customers before the first sip.</p>
        
        <h4>2. Smooth, Non-Bitter Profile</h4>
        <p>One of the biggest complaints about commercial hotel tea is harshness. Sabnam Gold's formulation specifically addresses this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Controlled Tannin Levels:</strong> Strong enough to taste like proper tea, gentle enough to avoid bitterness.</li>
          <li><strong>Smooth Mouthfeel:</strong> Doesn't coat the mouth with unpleasant dryness.</li>
          <li><strong>No Burnt Notes:</strong> Even if accidentally over-brewed, doesn't turn harsh.</li>
          <li><strong>Milk Compatible:</strong> Works beautifully with varying milk quantities.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>3. Rapid Color Release: Kitchen Efficiency</h4>
        <p>Sabnam Gold features a higher percentage of fine fannings that deliver critical operational benefits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Faster Brewing:</strong> Color develops within 60-90 seconds, reducing wait times during service rush.</li>
          <li><strong>Fuel Savings:</strong> Less boiling time = lower gas/electricity consumption across hundreds of daily cups.</li>
          <li><strong>Labor Efficiency:</strong> More forgiving if attention shifts to other tasks; consistent results with minimal supervision.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Daily consumption:</strong> 400-450 grams</li>
          <li><strong>Cost per cup:</strong> ₹1.80-2.10 (including milk, sugar, fuel)</li>
          <li><strong>Monthly tea cost:</strong> ₹3,600-4,200</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>vs. Premium Blend:</strong> Saves ₹2,400-3,000/month with no noticeable quality difference for most diners.</p>
        <p><strong>vs. Economy Blend:</strong> Invests ₹1,500-1,800 more/month but eliminates bitter taste complaints and protects brand reputation.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Smoothness Advantage</h3>
        <p>Many commercial hotel blends use high-dust compositions that extract quickly but create unpleasant astringency. Sabnam Gold uses <strong>fine fannings rather than dust</strong>—a critical distinction:</p>

      <section>
        <p>This is raw power in a cup. Our <strong>Hotel Special Dust</strong> is not 'leftover' powder—it is premium <strong>Primary Dust (PD)</strong> graded tea designed for maximum extraction and uncompromising strength. Engineered for the high-volume 'Chai' service industry where speed, consistency, and bold flavor are non-negotiable, this is the choice of professionals serving hundreds of cups an hour without losing liquor quality.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Power of Instant Infusion</h3>
        <p>Upon contact with boiling water, this tea explodes with color and strength. Because the particle size is extremely fine, the surface area for extraction is maximized—delivering full-bodied flavor the moment water hits the leaves.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Instant Color:</strong> Deep, reddish-brown liquor within seconds that signals quality at first glance.</li>
          <li><strong>Cuts Through Everything:</strong> Specifically curated to hold its strength through the thickest milk and strongest ginger/cardamom spices—the tea taste is never lost.</li>
          <li><strong>Highest Yield:</strong> Delivers the maximum number of cups per kilogram of any product in our range.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost Effective:</strong> The most economical way to serve quality tea at scale without compromise.</li>
        </ul>

          <dd>The favorite for 'Kadak Chai'. Holds its strength perfectly even with high milk-to-water ratios. Built for the daily grind where consistency equals reputation.</dd>
